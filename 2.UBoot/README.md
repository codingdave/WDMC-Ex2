# UBoot: The funny part

If you reach this part of the procedure, this is the funny part :smile:

Uboot is the SW code executed by the chip in order to load the kernel.
It is quite good utility, altough the documentation is not the best asset.
You can find useful commands here: [Uboot User Manual](https://hub.digi.com/dp/path=/support/asset/u-boot-reference-manual/)

## Press `1`

If you want to have access to the Uboot procedure, you shall keep the button `1` pressed during the boot sequence.
If is important you check the reliability of the serial connection as describer in the [Section 1](../1.SerialCable/README.md)
