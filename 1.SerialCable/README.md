# KC-YCDI

![Keep calm, You can do it](KC-YCDI.png)

This is the most tricky part of the guide, but you will understand the benefit and the skill you learnt at the end of the procedure.

## You need:
1. to disassemble your device
2. get access to the serial pins
3. solder 3 dupont cables
4. connect the serial to another device; I used a Rasperry PI with a "USB to UART" serial adapter.

## Disassemble your device

There are no specific instruction, here. You just need some patience and unscrew it.
In My device there are just 4 main screws:
+ 2 visible on top near the disk enclosure
+ 2 on the base, accessible after you remove the plastic cover

Then you need to unscrew the metal chassis and to get access to the board.

## Get access to the serial pins

The board has a space dedicated to the serial connection. See this picture:

Should your board be different, WD adopt the convention of keeping the same drawing for the serial connection
