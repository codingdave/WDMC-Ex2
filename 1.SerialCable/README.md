# Keep calm, you can do it

This is the most tricky part of the guide, but you will understand the benefit and the skill you learnt at the end of the procedure.

## You need:
1. to disassemble your device
2. get access to the serial pins
3. solder 3 dupont cables
4. connect the serial to another device; I used a Rasperry PI with a "USB to UART" serial adapter.
